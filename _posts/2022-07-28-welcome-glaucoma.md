# Greetings friends! 
My name is M A and I will be posting about everything I learn because it will be useful for me and for anyone who like me is just starting out
**in the hacking world**, I hope you enjoy my posts as much as I will enjoy writing them.

## Main objectives 
The main goal of this blog is to create a writing habit to accompany  **my studies in cybersecurity**. Generate publications that will help me to mark my progress, since I will not be publishing daily, but once I master the topic of my study I will summarize it in a publication, that is, I **plan to be rigorous and take it seriously**.  The chosen topic is the one I am most passionate about and you can see it on the main page: cybersecurity, Linux and protocols.


## Motivations
My main motivation is to prove myself that I am able to be constant and to achieve my **professional goals one by one**. Another motivation is to use a foreign language (English) to produce content that can be useful for other people who are in the same situation as me and I know this because I have **spent hours searching the internet** myself and this way, with my publications I can save time or at least serve as a starting point for many people.

## Structure 
In all posts I will try to follow the same structure. First of all, I will give a short summary of the topic, followed by a more detailed body of the article and finally I will give you my assessments and impressions.

## Until the next post!
It only remains for me to thank you for reading these lines and wish you a happy day.

Thank you for your time!
